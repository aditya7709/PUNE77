3. Plan Growth Rate:
P1 is the only plan with significant positive growth (+32%), showing strong user adoption.
Plans P2 to P9 have a declining growth rate, with P9 and P10 at -100%, suggesting they might be discontinued or unattractive to users.
4. ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) Before and After 5G Introduction:
Post-5G (A5G) ARPU is consistently higher than Pre-5G (B5G) across all time periods.
This suggests that 5G plans generate higher revenue per user, making them more profitable.
5. Unsubscribes Trend:
Unsubscribes for both Pre-5G (B5G) and Post-5G (A5G) peaked in time period 3 (B5G: 18.7, A5G: 19.1).
Unsubscribes slightly decreased afterward, but A5G still shows higher churn than B5G.
6. Active Users Trend:
Active Users in Post-5G (A5G) consistently outnumber Pre-5G (B5G), showing a shift towards 5G adoption.
The highest number of active users occurred in time period 3 for A5G (228) and time period 4 for B5G (211).

Summary and Recommendations:
✔ 5G Plans are More Profitable – The ARPU for 5G is higher, indicating a shift in user preference towards high-speed plans. Marketing should focus on encouraging more users to transition to 5G.

✔ Plan Optimization Needed – Plans P9 and P10 have shown a 100% decline, meaning they either need to be restructured or replaced with better options.

✔ Target Cities for Growth – Lucknow, Gurgaon, and Patna are showing positive growth, so expanding offerings and marketing in these cities can boost revenue further.

✔ High Churn in 5G Users – Even though 5G plans generate more revenue, unsubscribe rates are higher than B5G. This indicates that service quality or pricing might need adjustments.

✔ Revenue-Driving Plans – P1, P4, and P11 contribute the most revenue. Strategies should be designed to retain users on these plans and offer attractive incentives to prevent churn.
